RVcore Project

RISC-V is a RISC-based open instruction set architecture.
The basic 32-bit integer instruction set in RISC-V is defined as RV32I.
We are developing an optimized RV32I processor named RVCoreP, 
adopting five-stage pipelining targetting both FPGAs and ASICs.
This project aims to evaluate our preliminary processor design
regarding operating frequency and power consumption.
